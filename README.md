A tiny but effective application for counting objects over an image

What is it?
===========

TheEggCounter is a simple application for counting objects over a image. This involves placing markers over the object to visually ease the count so the objects are not counted twice.

The user is able to mark/unmark the objects, thus increasing/decreasing the count. After counting, the user is able to record the number of items and create a copy of the original image with the number of items counted on it.

History and motivation
----------------------
Counting objects on images, despite being a pretty simple task, usually involves the usage of complicated/expensive image analysis software. This software usually carry licenses or hardware keys that makes difficult to share the software among many users. Using OSS software like ImageJ doesn't make it better because in both cases software is complicated.

During the processing of the samples of a Daily Egg Production Method Survey on the European anchovy of the Gulf of Cadiz carried out in summer 2014, I realized that a very simple application for counting the hydrated eggs of the female hydrated gonads (a key step in the DEPM spawning biomass estimation proccess) could be the solution for the bottlenecks caused for having to share the image analysis system with other research groups, freeing the system of trivial tasks like counting eggs in favor of other activities, mainly taking pictures.
